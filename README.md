# MyRamadanScheduler

Welcome to **MyRamadanScheduler**, a web-based tool crafted exclusively for **UniKL students** to create and adjust their personal Ramadan schedules. Designed by the **International EXCO** from **UniKL MIIT**, this app converts your regular UniKL class times into Ramadan-friendly timings, accounting for shorter days and Friday prayer breaks. **Note**: This tool is tailored specifically for UniKL schedules and won’t work for other schools, colleges, or places.

We encourage UniKL students to use this tool and recommend it to your friends within the UniKL community!

## Features
- **Time Adjustment**: Converts UniKL class times to Ramadan hours (e.g., 8:30 AM becomes 8:00 AM - 8:40 AM).
- **Friday Prayer Support**: Adjusts Friday schedules with a prayer break (e.g., 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM).
- **Dynamic Preview**: See your UniKL schedule update live as you add entries.
- **PNG Download**: Export your schedule as a high-quality image.
- **Persistent Data**: Saves your schedule across refreshes with `localStorage`.

## How to Use (For UniKL Students)
1. Select a **day** (Monday to Saturday).
2. Choose your **start** and **end times** based on your UniKL timetable.
3. Enter a **class name** (e.g., "Physics" or "Programming").
